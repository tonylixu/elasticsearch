## How To Use Rally To Benchmarking Your Cluster

### What is Rally?
Rally is the macrobenchmarking framework for Elasticsearch. It can help you with the followings:
* Setup and teardown of an Elasticsearch cluster for benchmarking
* Management of benchmark data and specifications even across Elasticsearch versions
* Running benchmarks and recording results
* Finding performance problems by attaching so-called telemetry devices
* Comparing performance results

In general, Rally works with all versions of Elasticsearch starting from 1.x but benchmarking with plugins and benchmarking source builds will only work from Elasticsearch 5.0 onwards.
